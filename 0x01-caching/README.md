# Topic: Caching Systems
This project contains tasks that demonstrate various caching techniques.

## Tasks completed
+ [x] 0. **Basic Cache**: Implements a class `BasicCache` that inherits from `BaseCaching` and is a caching system.
+ [x] 1. **FIFO Cache**: Implements a class `FIFOCache` that inherits from `BaseCaching` and is a caching system with a First-In, First-Out algorithm.
+ [x] 2. **LIFO Cache**: Implements a class `LIFOCache` that inherits from `BaseCaching` and is a caching system with a Last-In, First-Out algorithm.
+ [x] 3. **LRU Cache**: Implements a class `LRUCache` that inherits from `BaseCaching` and is a caching system with a Least Recently Used algorithm.
+ [x] 4. **MRU Cache**: Implements a class `MRUCache` that inherits from `BaseCaching` and is a caching system with a Most Recently Used algorithm.
+ [x] 5. **LFU Cache**: Implements a class `LFUCache` that inherits from `BaseCaching` and is a caching system with a Least Frequently Used algorithm.
+ [x] 6. **Advanced LFU Cache**: Implements a class `AdvancedLFUCache` that inherits from `BaseCaching` and is a caching system with an advanced Least Frequently Used algorithm.

This project is a great resource for understanding how to implement various caching techniques in practical scenarios.
